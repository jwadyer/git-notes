  <H2>Version Control</H2>
  <p>Version control is a way of managing changes to a codebase. It enables developers to:
    <ul>
      <li>Switch between different versions of the code (e.g. for different features)</li>
      <li>See how the codebase has changed over time, and the reasons for those changes</li>
      <li>Make collaborative decisions over which chages to keep</li>
      <li> Rollback to an older version, if something breaks</li> 
    </ul>
    Break the code, Break the code. Let's Break the Code!
